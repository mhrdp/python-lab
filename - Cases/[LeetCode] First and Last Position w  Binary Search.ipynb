If it was bigger, then we can ignore the lower values and move the smallest value to `middle + 1` index, if it was smaller we can ignore the bigger values and move the biggest value to `middle - 1` index. Repeat than process untill you got into the target value.\n","\n","For this specific case, after we found the target value, we will look for the `start` and `end` of that value, if any:\n","```\n","i = middle\n","if LeftBias: # if True, we will find the 'right' value\n","    right = i - 1\n","else: # if False, find 'left' value\n","    left = i + 1\n","```\n","`LeftBias` parameter is to tell the program whether we look for `left` value or `right` value. After the `middle` value equal to `target`, all we need is to adjust the position of `left` and `right`.\n","\n","One thing that I don't really understand is `return i`, because by the end what we updated are the value of `left` and `right`, not `i`. So why when we return i, what was actually returned were the value of `left` and `right`?"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"TY2WLOsvwnMA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629704158864,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":373,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}}},"source":["def binary_first_and_last(nums, target):\n","    left_val = binary_search(nums, target, True)\n","    right_val = binary_search(nums, target, False)\n","    return [left_val, right_val]\n","\n","def binary_search(nums, target, LeftBias):\n","    left = 0\n","    right = len(nums)-1\n","    i = -1\n","\n","    while left <= right:\n","        middle = (left + right) // 2\n","        if target < nums[middle]:\n","            right = middle - 1\n","        elif target > nums[middle]:\n","            left = middle + 1\n","        else:\n","            i = middle\n","            if LeftBias: # if True, we will find the 'right' value\n","                right = i - 1\n","            else: # if False, find 'left' value\n","                left = i + 1\n","    return i"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"w5PXboTy6H3L"},"source":["# Brute Force\n","This method was straight forward, basically we will iterate through the whole list both from the `start` index and `end` index until it finally equal to `target` value."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Uh9NSH_x6Mva","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629704161192,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":1332,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}}},"source":["def searchRange(nums, target):\n","    start = 0\n","    end = len(nums)-1\n","    \n","    if not target in nums or not nums:\n","        return [-1, -1]\n","    \n","    if nums.count(target) == 1:\n","        return [nums.index(target), nums.index(target)]\n","    \n","    i = 0\n","    while i < len(nums):\n","        if nums[start] != target:\n","            start += 1\n","        if nums[end] != target:\n","            end -= 1\n","        i += 1\n","    \n","    return [start, end]"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1kT2BOU52X8M","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629704853382,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":347,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"403826cb-4612-4fac-acee-e769bff2ef90"},"source":["nums1 = [5,7,7,8,8,8,10]\n","target1 = 8\n","\n","nums2 = [5,7,7,8,8,10]\n","target2 = 6\n","\n","nums3 = []\n","target3 = 0\n","\n","print('Binary Tree:')\n","print(binary_first_and_last(nums1, target1))\n","print(binary_first_and_last(nums2, target2))\n","print(binary_first_and_last(nums3, target3))\n","\n","print('Brute Force:')\n","print(searchRange(nums1, target1))\n","print(searchRange(nums2, target2))\n","print(searchRange(nums3, target3))"],"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Binary Tree:\n","[3, 5]\n","[-1, -1]\n","[-1, -1]\n","Brute Force:\n","[3, 5]\n","[-1, -1]\n","[-1, -1]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
