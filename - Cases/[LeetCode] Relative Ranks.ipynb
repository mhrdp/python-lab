First we will initialize empty dictionary: `rank_dict = {}`; and set current ranking to `0`: `rank = 0`\n","2. Then we will iterate through the `list` inside the function argument with `for` loop, and append it to `rank_dict`\n","3. After that we will sort `rank_dict` from big to small with `sorted()[::-1]`. We will assign it to `sorted_rank_dict` variable.\n","    - **Note**: After `dict` object being `sorted()`, it will become `list` object with `dict's key` is its values. See [here](#scrollTo=8qtKskg5UBno&line=2&uniqifier=1)\n","4. Then we will use `try.. except..` module to begin determine the medal of each player. Inside `try`, we will:\n","    - Use `sorted_rank_dict` first value to third value (index no. 0 to no. 2) as a `dict's key` for `rank_dict` dictionary, and change it values from `0` to `'Gold Medal'`, `'Silver Medal'`, `'Bronze Medal'` respectively.\n","    - And don't forget to specify the rank placement for each respective medal.\n","5. In `except` module, we will just `pass`\n","6. Increment the `rank` by 1: `rank += 1`. This is needed because the next rank is `4`, while before this point the `rank` value is still `3`.\n","7. Lastly, we will iterate through `sorted_rank_dict` with `for` loop with `j` as its variable. Inside it we will:\n","    - Add `if` condition that will take `rank_dict[j] == 0` as its argument. Meaning that, if `rank_dict[j]` value is equal to `0`, which means every value **above rank 3**.\n","    - If true, we will change its value by current `rank`.\n","8. Return `rank_dict.values()`.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"bRz0lP1ASeiO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629358655600,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":359,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"71c637f9-6a81-4e55-dda3-9416546ebc68"},"source":["def find_relative_rank(list_rank):\n","    rank_dict = {}\n","    rank = 0\n","\n","    for i in list_rank:\n","        rank_dict[i] = 0\n","    \n","    sorted_rank_dict = sorted(rank_dict)[::-1]\n","\n","    try:\n","        rank_dict[sorted_rank_dict[0]] = 'Gold Medal'\n","        rank = 1\n","\n","        rank_dict[sorted_rank_dict[1]] = 'Silver Medal'\n","        rank = 2\n","\n","        rank_dict[sorted_rank_dict[2]] = 'Bronze Medal'\n","        rank = 3\n","    except:\n","        pass\n","    \n","    rank += 1\n","\n","    for j in sorted_rank_dict:\n","        if rank_dict[j] == 0:\n","            rank_dict[j] = str(rank)\n","            rank += 1\n","    return rank_dict.values()\n","\n","list_a = [5,4,3,2,1]\n","list_b = [10,3,8,9,4]\n","\n","print('List a:', find_relative_rank(list_a))\n","print('List b:', find_relative_rank(list_b))"],"execution_count":15,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["List a: dict_values(['Gold Medal', 'Silver Medal', 'Bronze Medal', '4', '5'])\n","List b: dict_values(['Gold Medal', '5', 'Bronze Medal', 'Silver Medal', '4'])\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zwQbK9KAWmEH"},"source":["## About `sorted()` when combined with `dict`\n","It seems like when you sorted `dict` object using `sorted()`, it will convert into `list` object with `dict's keys` as its value.
