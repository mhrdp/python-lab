I usually use `set()` to remove duplicate object inside `list`, but now I learnt I can use it as a way to store an objects.\n","```\n","Hash = set()\n","```\n","### To explain...\n","A `set` is a mutable collection of distinct hashable objects, same as the `list` and `tuple`. It is an unordered collection of objects, meaning it **does not record element position or order of insertion** and so **cannot access elements using indexes**.\n","\n","**A `set` doesn't store duplicate objects**. Even if an object is added more than once inside the curly brackets, only one copy is held in the set object. Hence, indexing and slicing operations cannot be done on a `set` object.\n","\n","The order of elements in the set is not necessarily the same as the order given at the time of assignment. Python optimizes the structure of a set for performing operations over it, as defined in mathematics.\n","\n","Only immutable (and hashable) objects can be a part of a set object. Numbers (integer, float, as well as complex), strings, and tuple objects are accepted, but set, list, and dictionary objects are not."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6htTqVP-fpeX"},"source":["Read more about set: [here](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-set#:~:text=A%20set%20is%20a%20mutable,of%20the%20set%20in%20Mathematics.)\n","\n","The important part from that article are:\n","1.
