First we will initialize the <code>prefix</code> list, to later append the common prefix to show the result\n","2. Then we will iterate through all the items inside the list, few things to note here: <br>\n","  - <code>\\*</code> symbol used in <code>zip(\\*<i>list_of_string</i>)</code> is to 'unzip' the list before being 'zipped'\n","  - When the 'unzipped' list being 'zipped' again with <code>zip()</code>, it will return the first letter in the collection of words -- that previously a list -- as a row, make it vertically sorted instead of horizontally. Look at the example here: <a href=\"N#scrollTo=ZFPp46ag2OAO&line=4&uniqifier=1\">example</a>\n","3. On each iteration, using <code>if</code> conditional, find a first few iterations that return exactly one (1) letter and immediatedly <code>break</code> the loop once it return more that one (1) letter. To make it clearer, here's the logic:\n","  - We will be using <code>set()</code> method to combine all the the similar letter in each iteration, and count the length of the returned set with <code>len()</code> method.\n","  - If the <code>len()</code> is anything more than one (1), that means that iteration was not compromised of a common letters between each word, which is not what we want so it will trigger <code>break</code> parameter to stop the program.\n","  - If the <code>len()</code> is exactly one (1) that mean we find a common letter, and it will continue to the next iteration until the <code>len()</code> did not return one (1).\n","4. For each iteration, we will append the <code>True</code> value to a new list and convert it into a string using <code>''.join(<i>iterable</i>)</code> method.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"zIr2SkiMxM9q","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1628057523590,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":27,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"93ab6bf4-374d-4344-d978-11e7233ca04f"},"source":["list_of_string = ['flow', 'flower', 'flick']\n","\n","prefix = []\n","for i in zip(*list_of_string):\n","  if len(set(i)) != 1:\n","    break\n","  else:\n","    prefix.append(i[0])\n","print(''.join(prefix))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["fl\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ZFPp46ag2OAO","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629250611887,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":348,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"e6f3d437-bc0f-46c3-d808-e20a3fffc848"},"source":["list_of_string = ['flow', 'flower', 'flick']\n","\n","print('Unzipped result with * :')\n","print(*list_of_string)\n","\n","print('\\nResult after unzipped and zipped back:')\n","for i in zip(*list_of_string):\n","  print(i)"],"execution_count":12,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Unzipped result with * :\n","flow flower flick\n","\n","Result after unzipped and zipped back:\n","('f', 'f', 'f')\n","('l', 'l', 'l')\n","('o', 'o', 'i')\n","('w', 'w', 'c')\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
