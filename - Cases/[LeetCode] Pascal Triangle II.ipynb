We need to add `+ 1` to the `num_row` because of how Pascal Triagle works, which basically four items for row three, three items for row 2, etc\n","\n","2. Then we initialize `previous_list` and `current_list`. We will modify the `previous_list` items and rewrite `current_list` items with its value. During initial initialization, you add 1 (one) as an item and multiply it by the row number that provided by funtion's argument **after the `+ 1` addition**. See example <a href=\"#scrollTo=dnnJJlQR3JbS&line=6&uniqifier=1\">here</a>\n","\n","3. We then do a double `for` loop, first for will take the **range** of `num_row`, while the second for loop will take the iteration of first for loop plus one.\n","  - **First for loop**: this to create a number of iterations equal to the length of the end result, as list has a 0 index value, we don't need to add `+ 1` because that already taken care at the very beginning\n","  - **Second for loop**: we took an interation from **first for loop** and **add it by one**, probably to avoid having range(0), which I would bet, not a valid argument\n","\n","4. Add `if else` condition inside the second for loop\n","  - The `if` is to fill in the start and the end of the list, which is always has one as its value\n","  - The `else` is to fill in what's in between, which is an addition of current index (j) and the next index (j-1)\n","\n","5. Lastly we will rewrite the `previous_list` with the `current_list`, which was an updated version"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S_AnYlwJ155r"},"source":["Problem: Find a Pascal value of any given row"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"pHZIsILSzF-N","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629266336154,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":20,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"c669ebfe-0d91-4514-ca61-1bf7fd95494a"},"source":["def pascal_triangle(num_row):\n","    num_row += 1\n","    previous_list = [1] * num_row\n","    current_list = [1] * num_row\n","    \n","    for i in range(num_row):\n","        for j in range(i+1):\n","            if j == 0 or j == i:\n","                current_list[j] = previous_list[j]\n","            else:\n","                current_list[j] = previous_list[j-1] + previous_list[j]\n","        previous_list = current_list[:]\n","    return current_list\n","\n","print(pascal_triangle(3))"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["[1, 3, 3, 1]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"dnnJJlQR3JbS","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1629266719758,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":591,"user":{"displayName":"Mahardhika Dwi","photoUrl":"","userId":"18064939782869251856"}},"outputId":"c5b2c457-8457-494c-a6ad-b2e56ff50bc2"},"source":["# Let's say we have three (3) as a input\n","\n","arr = [1]\n","n = 3\n","\n","arr * n"],"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["[1, 1, 1]"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":2}]}]}
