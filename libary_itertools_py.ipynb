In nutshell, <code>itertools</code> composed of numbers of fast and memory efficient methods that can help you to build an application in pure Python.\n","\n","To import <code>itertools</code> you only need to add: <code>import itertools</code> or to add specific function: <code>from itertools import <i>function_name</i></code>.\n","\n","<code>itertools</code> were divided into three sub-groups based on its application:\n","<ol>\n","  <li>Infinite iterators</li>\n","  <li>Iterators terminating on a shortest sequence</li>\n","  <li>Combinatoric generators</li>\n","</ol>\n","\n","## Infinite iterators\n","Iterator in Python is any Python type that can be used with a <code>for in loop</code>. Python lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all examples of inbuilt iterators. But it is not necessary that an iterator object has to exhaust, sometimes it can be <b>infinite</b>. Such type of iterators are known as Infinite iterators.\n","\n","Infinite iterators sub-group include:\n","<ol>\n","  <li><code>itertools.count(<i>start</i>, <i>step</i>)</code></li>\n","

Iterators terminating on shortest sequence\n","Terminating iterators are used to work on the short input sequences and produce the output based on the functionality of the method used.\n","\n","Different ways to terminating the program are:\n","<ol>\n","  <li><code>itertools.accumulate(<i>iterable</i>, <i>function</i>)</code></li>\n","
