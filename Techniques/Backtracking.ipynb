Whenever we find that current digit cannot lead to a solution, we remove it (backtrack) and try next digit. This is better than naive approach (generating all possible combinations of digits and then trying every combination one by one) as it drops a set of permutations whenever it backtracks."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"67GjQ42pJ1TU"},"source":["Problems which are typically solved using backtracking technique have the following property in common. \n","1. These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once. \n","2. A Naive solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output a configuration that follows given problem constraints.\n","\n","Backtracking works in an incremental way and is an optimization over the Naive solution where all possible configurations are generated and tried."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oNi4a5CoKluN"},"source":["Resources:\n","1.
